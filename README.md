Tutorial, how to use the program.

1. Open 'encrypt_message.py'.
2. Change plain_text value ( "YOUR-MESSAGE" ) into your actual one.
3. Run/Execute the 'encrypt_message.py'
4. Copy the output (key, iv...)
5. Create a file named 'key-iv.env'.
6. Paste what you just copied there, and change 'KEY: , IV:'
    into ENCRYPTION_KEY = , ENCRYPTION_IV =.
   7. Run the decryption program.


How you can send very safely messages with friend?

1. Send the encrypted message to your friend, ( Don't copy paste, because where
you paste the weird letters, may not be able to send there ), send the whole file.

2. Give to your friend the decrypt_message.py.

3. Tell your friend to create a file named 'key-iv.env'

4. Tell your friend in a SAFE place the actual KEY and IV. (It must be safe)

5. Then tell your friend to write/paste the key and iv into the 'key-iv.env' file.

And your friend has received the message. 

Your parents or anyone can't understand the message. If someone doesnt have the key and iv, but only has 'encrypted.bin',
it's trash to him, because can't understand it. But with key and iv, it's a treasure!
